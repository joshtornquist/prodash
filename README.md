Prodash is a web service that allows organizations with one or more teams to provide day-to-day updates in one place. At the end of each week, updates are compiled, summarized using ChatGPT, then emailed to organization leaders. 

In addition to the above service, Prodash features a dashboard where updates made by teams will be presented in real-time for data visualization.
