Prodash is a web app that allows organizations with one or more teams to provide day-to-day updates in one place. At the end of each week, updates are automatically compiled, summarized using text-davinci-003 through GPT-3, then emailed to organization leaders, clients, and team-leads. 

In addition to the above service, Prodash features a dashboard where updates made by teams will be presented in real-time for data visualization using Chart.js.
